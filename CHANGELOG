1. The piezo is tested on startup/reset likewise the LEDs.

2. Make the BUTTON more responsible in case of an error.

   NOTE: The BUTTON pin has moved to 'Digital I/O' pin 2 to use Interrupt 0.
         Only pin 2 and pin 3 can catch an external interrupt.

   The option "Type 'G'" to start the programmer is no longer supported.
   As the project name says -> 'adaStandalone'. Sorry.
